# NoHello

## Stop Starting Conversations with Just "Hello"

Starting a conversation with just **"hello"**, **"hi"**, or similar greetings is inefficient and adds unnecessary friction to communication, especially in online interactions.

---

## Why is "Hello" a Problem?

1. **It Wastes Time**:  
   - When you say "hello" without context, the recipient has to respond and wait for you to explain the purpose of the message.  
   - Example:  
     - **You**: "Hello!"  
     - **Them**: "Hi, how can I help you?"  
     - (Now you've taken two messages to say what could have been said in one.)

2. **It Creates Unnecessary Anxiety**:  
   - The recipient may feel uncertain or worried about what the message is about, especially if it's in a professional context.

3. **It’s Not Productive**:  
   - Imagine a busy person receiving dozens of "hello" messages. They waste time just figuring out what each person wants.

## What Should You Do Instead?

When starting a conversation, **get straight to the point**. Provide context upfront so the recipient can respond effectively.

### Good Example:
> Hi, I’m working on a project about X and I need help with Y.  
> Can you assist me with Z?

### Bad Example:
> You: "Hello."  
> Them: "Hi, how can I help you?"  
> You: "I need help with a project."

This simple change saves time and improves communication for everyone involved.

## Guidelines for Effective Communication

1. **State Your Purpose Clearly**:  
   - Before saying "hello," write down what you need to communicate.

2. **Use Friendly, Direct Language**:  
   - Example:  
     > Hi! I’m reaching out because I noticed [specific issue]. Could you help me resolve it?

3. **Don’t Leave People Guessing**:  
   - Be specific about what you need help with.

4. **Respect Their Time**:  
   - Avoid unnecessary back-and-forth by including all relevant details in your first message.
